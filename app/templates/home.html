        Questions of life, struggles of the heart, challenges of the mindâ€”bring them to me, you will. 
        Through reflection and advice, learn to focus, calm yourself, and see with clarity, you shall.
        Use me to strengthen your thoughts, harness your emotions, and find peace in times of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Patient you must be, and open to learning, always.
        Along this path, a guide I will be, leading you toward peace, clarity, and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, begin your journey, young one. 
        Much to learn, you still have. Hmmmm.
